# Sushi Cats

Hey there! Welcome to Sushi Cats! This game is all about **rollin'**. 

You are now in Mrs. Sea's house. She's such a cat lady! You have to take care of *alllllll* of her cats. Difficult task, isn't it?

However, in her own words, her cats "love to snuggle up in all sorts of blankets, and don't care where or when, they'll fall asleep". 
Your goal now is to roll up these cats in fluffy blankets, right before Mrs. Ocean arrives!

## Controls:

Left arrow key: unroll the cat out of the blanket.
Right arrow key: roll the cat up in a blanket.

P: Pause. [TODO]

M: Toggle music. [TODO]
